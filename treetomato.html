              <h2 class="mt-3 text-centre">Tamarilo</h2>
                <h4 class="mt-5"> Description.</h4>
       <p>Tamarillo Fruit is relative of the potato, tomato, eggplant and capsicum pepper. </p>
          <p>The tree tomato is native to Central and South America. 
        Tamarillo Fruit is a source of Vitamin A, B6 and C. Tamarillo also contains Vitamin E and Thiamine.</p> 
        <p> Vitamin A plays a role in maintaining vision, immune function and skin health. It is also important for 
         bone metabolism and the production of blood cells. 
        For your recommended daily intake in relation to the recommended daily intake of minerals, Tamarillo 
        can contribute to intakes of potassium, manganese and copper. Vitamin C, E and B-carotene (provitamin A) 
        have been regarded as the major nutritional antioxidants for many years. </p>
       <p>Tamarillo contains vitamins C and E, phenolics (including anthocyanins and other flavonoids) plus carotenoids. 
        Antioxidants protect against the harmful effects of free radicals and other reactive oxidants.
         There are a number of diseases in which free radicals have been implicated including the universal
          degenerative diseases of aging such as cancer, heart disease, cataracts, and diseases with more specific
          
          causes such as Parkinson’s disease and pancreatitis. 
          </p> 
          <p>Potassium is found in body fluids and is essential for the 
          proper functioning of cells, including nerves. It’s important in preventing high blood pressure. Manganese, like
           many other minerals, is an important part of enzymes (particularly those involved in amino acid, cholesterol and
            carbohydrate metabolism) and it is also involved in the formation of bone. The body needs copper to be able to use 
            iron properly. Other important minerals available from tamarillos include: selenium, phosphorus, boron, zinc, iron,
             chromium and molybdenum. Vitamin C has a number of important body functions. It helps produce collagen
              (a cement that helps with the structure of muscles, vascular tissues, bones and cartilage). It also contributes
               to healthy teeth and gums, aids wound healing, fights infection, and is necessary for iron absorption (another
                reason for having Tamarillo sauce or chutney with red meats).</p> Vitamin B6 helps maintain normal nerve function
                 and also acts in the formation of red blood cells. Vitamin B6 is also required for the chemical reactions
                  needed to digest proteins, the higher the protein intake, the greater the need for vitamin B6.
                  <p>Vitamin E covers a group of fat-soluble compounds called tocopherols and tocotrienols.
                    Alpha-tocopherol is the most common and biologically active. Its main functions are as an important antioxidant.
                     It also provides dietary support for healthy heart, lung, prostate and digestive tract function
                     .</p> <p>Tamarillo rate very highly as a source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants when compared with other common fruits and vegetables.
